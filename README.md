_Tag Mixing_ App
====

A playground game design workshop.

_Tag Mixing_ App is going to be an application for creating playground games, like variants of tag or hide-and-seek. Features will include making new games from scratch, sharing games, remixing shared games, forking games into different games, and hacking traditional games. Itâ€™s based on the _Tag Mixing_ Modules ([repository](https://github.com/nclm/tagmixing-modules)).
